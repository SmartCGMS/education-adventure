8;What do I need?
9;I need to brush my teeth, get my backpack and pack a snack my mom prepared for me
10;So let's get going, I must leave soon!
11;Prepare for school

21;Great, I made it in time for the lecture!
22;Let's find a seat and listen to the teacher

25;Teacher: Diabetes is a disease. It has two basic types - type 1 and type 2.
26;Teacher: It manifests with elevated glucose levels in your body, which is bad for you.
27;Teacher: Diabetes type 1 is autoimmune and if you have it, you probably already know it.
28;Teacher: It is diagnosed in an early age and needs a special attention.
29;Teacher: Type 2 is diagnosed later in life and is often a result of an unhealthy lifestyle.
30;Teacher: Let's focus on type 1!
31;Teacher: When you eat something sweet, you probably ingest some form of sugar.
32;Teacher: Sugar comes in many forms, but your body always breaks it down to a molecule called glucose.
33;Teacher: Glucose is what powers your whole body. Without it, you wouldn't even move!
34;Teacher: However... too much glucose is bad for you. If you had diabetes, ingesting sugar in greater doses can actually be dangerous!
35;Teacher: Healthy body will take care of excess glucose, but a body of a diabetic person won't.
36;Teacher: The excess glucose wanders around your body and in time, it damages your body from inside.
37;Teacher: And that is something you definitely don't want! But don't worry, there is a solution.
38;Teacher: A healthy body produces a hormone called insulin to take care of excess glucose.
39;Teacher: A diabetic person needs to dose insulin on his own based on how much glucose there is to take care of.
40;Teacher: This could be done using an injection, insulin pen or insulin pump.
41;Teacher: The modern solution is to use the insulin pump - it is so easy!
42;Teacher: Just set the right amount, push the button and it is basically all you need.
43;Teacher: You can dose the insulin in a single greater dose - that is called a bolus insulin.
44;Teacher: Or, you can set an insulin basal rate. This instructs the pump to dose small amounts, but over the whole day!
45;Teacher: And how much glucose there is to break down by insulin?
46;Teacher: Even this is an easy task for us - we have a sensor.
47;Teacher: It is called a CGM sensor. The 'CGM' stands for Continuous Glucose Monitoring.
48;Teacher: You just look at the screen of your phone and you immediatelly see the glucose!
49;Teacher: But before you dose anything, there is one key thing you must know.
50;Teacher: Too much insulin breaks down too much glucose and that is bad for you too.
51;Teacher: Just keep the glucose between 3.5 and 7 mmol/L and everything should be fine!
52;Teacher: Now... let us take a short exam to see, what have you learned.
53;- two basic types - type 1 and type 2
54;- elevated glucose levels in body
55;- food (sugar) = increased glucose levels
56;- insulin lowers glucose levels
57;- insulin pump doses insulin
58;   - bolus and basal insulin
59;- CGM sensor shows glucose levels
60;- keep glucose between 3.5 and 7 mmol/L !
61;Diabetes basics exam
62;How does diabetes manifest?
63;Elevated blood glucose
64;Headaches
65;Skin color change
66;When you ingest food, what does your glucose level do?
67;Increases
68;Decreases
69;Stays the same
70;Decreases rapidly and then increases
71;What helps you lower the glucose levels in a healthy way?
72;Insulin
73;Glucagon
74;Starving
75;How do you determine your current glucose levels?
76;Using CGM sensor
77;I guess it
78;I ask my doctor
79;In what range should the glucose level be?
80;3.5 - 7.0 mmol/L
81;1 - 10 mmol/L
82;20 - 30 mmol/L
83;There is no range
84;Next
85;Finish
86;Great job! Some of you scored well.
87;Some of you still need to study!
88;The class is over for now, see you after lunch!
89;Lunch time!
90;Pick a lunch
91;Take bolus insulin
92;Eat lunch
93;Teacher: Come on now, find your seat, the lecture starts soon!
94;Hey! How are you?
95;I wonder what we will learn today!
96;The teacher seems to be in a good mood today!
