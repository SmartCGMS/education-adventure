25;Teacher: Diabetes is a disease. It has two basic types - type 1 and type 2.
26;Teacher: It manifests with elevated glucose levels in your body, which is bad for you.
27;Teacher: Diabetes type 1 is autoimmune and if you have it, you probably already know it.
28;Teacher: It is diagnosed in an early age and needs a special attention.
29;Teacher: Type 2 is diagnosed later in life and is often a result of an unhealthy lifestyle.
30;Teacher: Let's focus on type 1!
31;Teacher: When you eat something sweet, you probably ingest some form of sugar.
32;Teacher: Sugar comes in many forms, but your body always breaks it down to a molecule called glucose.
33;Teacher: Glucose is what powers your whole body. Without it, you wouldn't even move!
34;Teacher: However... too much glucose is bad for you. If you had diabetes, ingesting sugar in greater doses can actually be dangerous!
35;Teacher: Healthy body will take care of excess glucose, but a body of a diabetic person won't.
36;Teacher: The excess glucose wanders around your body and in time, it damages your body from inside.
37;Teacher: And that is something you definitely don't want! But don't worry, there is a solution.
38;Teacher: A healthy body produces a hormone called insulin to take care of excess glucose.
39;Teacher: A diabetic person needs to dose insulin on his own based on how much glucose there is to take care of.
40;Teacher: This could be done using an injection, insulin pen or insulin pump.
41;Teacher: The modern solution is to use the insulin pump - it is so easy!
42;Teacher: Just set the right amount, push the button and it is basically all you need.
43;Teacher: You can dose the insulin in a single greater dose - that is called a bolus insulin.
44;Teacher: Or, you can set an insulin basal rate. This instructs the pump to dose small amounts, but over the whole day!
45;Teacher: And how much glucose there is to break down by insulin?
46;Teacher: Even this is an easy task for us - we have a sensor.
47;Teacher: It is called a CGM sensor. The 'CGM' stands for Continuous Glucose Monitoring.
48;Teacher: You just look at the screen of your phone and you immediatelly see the glucose!
49;Teacher: But before you dose anything, there is one key thing you must know.
50;Teacher: Too much insulin breaks down too much glucose and that is bad for you too.
51;Teacher: Just keep the glucose between 3.5 and 7 mmol/L and everything should be fine!
52;Teacher: Now... let us take a short exam to see, what have you learned.
53;- two basic types - type 1 and type 2
54;- elevated glucose levels in body
55;- food (sugar) = increased glucose levels
56;- insulin lowers glucose levels
57;- insulin pump doses insulin
58;   - bolus and basal insulin
59;- CGM sensor shows glucose levels
60;- keep glucose between 3.5 and 7 mmol/L !
61;Diabetes basics exam
62;How does diabetes manifest?
63;Elevated blood glucose
64;Headaches
65;Skin color change
66;When you ingest food, what does your glucose level do?
67;Increases
68;Decreases
69;Stays the same
70;Decreases rapidly and then increases
71;What helps you lower the glucose levels in a healthy way?
72;Insulin
73;Glucagon
74;Starving
75;How do you determine your current glucose levels?
76;Using CGM sensor
77;I guess it
78;I ask my doctor
79;In what range should the glucose level be?
80;3.5 - 7.0 mmol/L
81;1 - 10 mmol/L
82;20 - 30 mmol/L
83;There is no range
84;Next
85;Finish
86;Great job! Some of you scored well.
87;Some of you still need to study!
88;The class is over for now, see you after lunch!
89;Lunch time!
90;Pick a lunch
91;Go to cafeteria
92;Eat lunch
93;Teacher: Come on now, find your seat, the lecture starts soon!
94;Hey! How are you?
95;I wonder what we will learn today!
96;The teacher seems to be in a good mood today!
97;Now is not a good time to leave classroom!
98;Beef on mushrooms, rice
99;Potato gnocchi, poppy seeds
100;Vegetable risotto
101;Rissole with potatoes
102;First, I need to pick up a tray!

113;PE class
114;Go to the playground
115;Finish the run
116;I feel pretty tired I might faint... And that's not the first time.
117;My mom said we will se a doctor this afternoon, maybe he will help me with that.
118;Better go see the doctor, my mom is already waiting for me!
119;Diabetologist clinic
120;Listen to the doctor
121;Learn to use the sensor
122;Learn to use the pump
123;Go home
124;I still need to eat my lunch before leaving!
125;Today, we will be running!
126;Run around the playground as fast as you can!
127;Do 3 full circles and then report back to me.

132;Doctor: Hello! How are you today?
133;Doctor: I understand that you have some trouble. Do you often feel exhausted?
134;Doctor: Do you often go to the toilet? Some headaches?
135;Me: Yes, all of it. Am I sick? What is it?
136;Doctor: Let me check something quickly. I will draw a drop of your blood to perform a quick test.
137;Doctor: Don't worry, it's just a little prick, you will feel almost nothing. Ready?
138;Doctor: There we go... Ah, yes, as I suspected. Your blood glucose level is 17 mmol/L, that's way too high.
139;Doctor: I am afraid you have diabetes. But don't worry, current technology will help you manage it.
140;Doctor: You just have to be careful about your actions from now on, and you will be just fine!
141;Doctor: I will give you a sensor to your arm. It is a small device, you will barely notice it.
142;Doctor: I will also give you a pump. We will go through it together, okay? Ready?
143;Me: Yeah, I guess...
144;Doctor: There we go! All set. Let's try it.
145;Doctor: Your sensor will tell you your blood glucose levels. Use your mobile phone to check it.
146;Doctor: Now press R to see your glucose!
147;Doctor: Great! Whenever your glucose drops below 3.5, stop what you're doing and eat something sweet. But not too much!
148;Doctor: And... whenever your glucose goes over 10.0, you should use insulin pump to dose some insulin. This will lower your glucose. But also - not too much!
149;Doctor: Now let's see your pump. Press T to see your pump display!
150;Doctor: Perfect! Dose bolus insulin when the glucose is too high to take immediate action
151;Doctor: Dose basal insulin as a continuous suply - not too high, but just fine to keep your steady levels within the range.
152;Doctor: Now you're all set.
153;Me: But what if I can't do it? What if I do something wrong?
154;Doctor: Don't worry, your parents will tell you what to do. For now, just try to be careful and do not dose too much insulin. Start at smaller doses.
155;Doctor: And if there is any problem, just call me or visit me here. Okay?
156;Me: Thank you, doctor! Good bye!
157;Doctor: Good bye!
158;Home again
159;Go home
160;I cannot leave, we have PE class!
161;I should listen to the doctor first.
